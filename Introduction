We are interested in the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination uptake for children in Scotland. This occurs at 12-13 months old and at 4-5 years old. The data is collected by the Scottish Childhood Immunisation Record System (SCIRS) who hold all the vaccination records for all children in Scotland. We are interested in data collected between 1998- when Wakefield et al. (1998) claimed a link between the vaccine and increased risk of autism- and 2013 where there were large outbreaks of measles in the UK. This article by Wakefield et al. (1998) was partially retractedin 2004 and then fully discredited in 2010 after no increased risk of autism was found.

Our particular study focuses on measles susceptibility in the 133 intermediate zones in Glasgow. We are looking to investigate the following questions of interest:

1.  Did Glasgow exhibit a change in measles susceptibility following the retraction of the Wakefield article?
2.  Did the change, if any, in measles susceptibility occur in 2004 alongise the articles' retraction?
